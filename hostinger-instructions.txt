## Additional Troubleshooting

### If you're still having issues with outgoing connections:

1. **Check .htaccess file**:
   - Make sure there are no rules blocking outgoing connections
   - You can add this line to allow outgoing connections:
     ```
     SetEnv allow_url_fopen On
     ```

2. **Check PHP memory limit**:
   - In PHP Configuration, ensure the memory limit is at least 128M

3. **Contact Hostinger Support**:
   - If you've tried all the above steps and still have issues
   - Provide them with the specific error messages you're receiving
   - Ask them to check if there are any server-level restrictions for outgoing API connections
